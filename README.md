# Campfire
### brought to you by Jacky Luong, Tony Cui, Brandon Lei

Imagine this: you're playing Hot Potato, but when you have the potato, you have to spit out some words onto a cumulative story that you and the others in the game are creating. The potato itself won't blow up, but there's only so much burn you can take! Sound intriguing? Well, behold Campfire! Campfire is a web-based multiplayer game where people can come together, whether friends or strangers (as we support both public and private games) to tell stories not *to* one another, but *with* one another. Everyone takes turns adding onto an overall story, and afterwards, you can visit the gallery to see all the tales that have been told in Campfire. 

**Features include:**

- Play as guest or as a user who has signed in (for ownership of your stories and profile personalization)
- Unlimited concurrent rooms (games), with a chat box in each room
- A ready button upon joining a room so a game only starts when sufficient players want it to
- Live updating text on every player's screen, even if the current player's turn hasn't finished yet
- Mini visual of players around a campfire with their profile pictures and health bars
- Smart API to generate a random but relevant title for each story based on its contents
